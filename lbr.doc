Add files to library:
LBR A libname file [file ... ]

List files in library:
LBR L libname

Extract files from library:
LBR E libname

.LBR is assumed as the filetype for libname, and should NOT be
included in the names in the above commands. Wildcards are NOT
currently supported. Currently E extracts all files, but eventually
it will be possible to extract just a list of files.
